# Identifying Drivers of Attrition Through People Analytics

This report analyzes employee attrition and engagement metrics across different dimensions such as gender, age, department, education, and job role satisfaction. The aim is to understand attrition rates and identify factors influencing an employee's decision to leave the organization.

## Summary

Various key performance indicators are examined, including total employee count, number of employees who left, attrition rate, number of current employees, and their average age. The data is filtered based on education, department, age brackets, and job role satisfaction levels.

## Analysis

## Approach

The report takes a multivariate analytical approach, filtering the data based on several criteria to uncover relationships and spot focus areas. Comparative visualizations like charts and graphs are used to present findings effectively. Correlations between various attributes are examined to gain insights beyond just high-level metrics. For example, assessing attrition variability after segmenting the data based on education, department, age, and satisfaction scores.

## Solution

The analyses and findings can help identify attrition hotspots and understand the key drivers of employee turnover. This will enable designing intervention strategies, career development programs, and policy changes to improve retention. Focusing retention efforts on at-risk profiles shown in the report could help optimize workforce planning and talent management. Regular reporting on KPIs can also assess the impact of any actions taken.
